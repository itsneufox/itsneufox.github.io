# Easy open.mp Server Installation

Welcome to the **open.mp Server Installation Guide**! This guide will walk you through the steps of setting up your server on Debian-based Linux systems.

{: .important }
> If you're currently using the SA:MP server and haven't transitioned to open.mp, [please stop here and read this guide first](https://github.com/adib-yg/openmp-server-installation)!

{: .important }
> The FCNPC plugin is not yet compatible with open.mp. If you rely on FCNPC, please hold off on deploying open.mp for now.  
> However, your support can help speed up development! [Consider donating via Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/openmultiplayer).
